#FinanciX

A Budgeting and Personal Finance App

This application's server was developed in a localhost server with XAMPP, using php and mysql(for the database). To make it runable you need to download and install XMAPP and copy the content of mine XMAPP folder (It's in server side folder)

The application itself is written in Web language (HTML, Javascript, PHP, CSS), it's been transformed into an app using Cordova.

As the server is in localhost, to be able to use the Database it's mandatory that the Smartphone and the server are in the same network.
